## Object Detection

### Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Object_detection.ipynb`) designed for performing object detection using deep learning frameworks.

### Features
- Implements object detection using pre-trained models.
- Designed for use in Python 3 environments.

### Prerequisites
To run this notebook, ensure the following dependencies are installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Required Python libraries:
  - `imageai`
  - `torch`
  - `tensorflow`
  - `numpy`
  - `os`

Install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install imageai torch torchvision tensorflow numpy
```

### Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the `Object_detection.ipynb` file.
2. Ensure that the required model file (e.g., `yolov3-tiny.pt`) is placed in the `models/` directory.
3. Launch the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Object_detection.ipynb
   ```
4. Run each cell sequentially to execute the object detection workflow.

### Troubleshooting
- Ensure all dependencies are installed and compatible with your Python version.
- Verify the paths to the model and input files are correctly set in the notebook.
- If you encounter errors related to missing files or dependencies, refer to the error logs for specific troubleshooting steps.
